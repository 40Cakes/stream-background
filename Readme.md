#  Stream Background

This is the background behind the [üî¥24/7 ‚ú®Shiny‚ú® Hunting Bot Stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W6OOnrx8g58).

Full credit for all sprites included: [Pok√©mon Showdown](https://pokemonshowdown.com/). ‚ù§Ô∏è
- Normal 3D sprites: https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/ani/?C=M;O=D
- Shiny 3D sprites: https://play.pokemonshowdown.com/sprites/ani-shiny/?C=M;O=D

Sprites have been re-uploaded to the repo, and are referenced locally to avoid smashing Showdown's servers if someone decides to set hundreds of background sprites.

## Notes
- Controllable parameters such as shiny odds, max onscreen Pok√©mon, reload rate etc. are at the top of [background.js](scripts/background.js).
- Designed to place floating Pok√©mon in the top ~3/5 of the screen, and all others at the bottom.
- Floating Pok√©mon are defined in [background_pokemon.js](scripts/background_pokemon.js).
- (TODO: fix) Contains many hard coded values that are designed to work specifically for `2560*1440` stream resolutions.
